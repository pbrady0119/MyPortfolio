            <h3>Be Versatile...</h3>
            <br>
                <p class="summary">Summary: The Ongoing Professional Practice Evaluation (OPPE) intitiative required hospitals to review a range of data related to the quality and safety of the care provided by each clinician.
                     As the developer, I worked with a team of Clinicians to define a list of 11 metrics to measure Provider proficiency </p>
            
    
            <p> In my experience, it is rare to be involved in a project from its earliest phase to when it goes into production, the OPPE project offered me the opportunity to do just that by. 
                After meeting with the group of physicians and establishing what data they wanted to use to measure Provider's performance for each metric, it was time to create 
                the data model by digging through the database objects and establishing how each should be connected. Next, I started the development producing numerous test files 
                for rounds of testing and validation for each of the 11 metrics. Once approved, I developed and provided the reporting solutions. Normally, this is where my role would significantly
                diminish, however, the team decided they wanted to utilize Epic-based dashboards to visualize the data instead of the more popular data visualization tools. With no other available resources 
                on the application teams, I decided to learn how to create the dashboards to prevent the project from falling behind. Once successful, I created comprehensive user documentation,
                established a troubleshooting and issue escalation protocol and designed the dashboard access provisioning process. These dashboards are widely used throughout
                the organization, provide valuable insight to clinicians and allow for improved patient care.

                <br>
                To me, one of the most pivotal aspects of development is problem solving. Being versatile, or at least being open to being versatile, allows you to take your blinders off
                and find solutions outside of the norm.

            <p class="summary">Summary: Transition from PeopleSoft to Workday</p>

            <p>
                Often times, the scope of a project can be so large it can be difficult to not get overwhelmed. This was never more apparent than when my organization switched
                financial/HR systems from PeopleSoft to Workday. Faced with an extremely aggressive timeline and limited resources, myself and one other developer were tasked with 
                handling all necessary reporting obligations for the implementation. These included performing impact assessments for hundreds of reporting assets, querying our database 
                for potential areas of liability, documenting all affected code and making changes to ensure things would run smoothly, endless test files, meetings and providing status updates
                to the larger team and our stakeholders. There were times, especially in the beginning, where it seemed the best option was the wave the white flag. Then I remembered one of 
                the first lessons I learned while coding, start small. As a developer, it is important to take large tasks and chunk it down into manageable pieces. Once we employed this approach
                our productivity increased and the project all of a sudden seemed more manageable. Although still underway, we completed the majority of the heavy lifting and the project is on pace for success.

            <h3>You're only as good as your data...</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="summary">Summary: Backfilling the Data Warehouse</p>

            <p>
                In my opinion, data integrity is the single most important aspect of data and analytics. The insights produced from bad data are just that, bad. Data integrity issues
                come in many shapes and sizes, ranging from human error to planned database column deprecation and replacement. It should always be at the forefront of a developers mind. Throughout my
                years as a developer I have been asked to perform many backfills in order to keep our source of truth accurate, but one in particular sticks out. I was tasked with running
                multiple data extracts to update a downstream reporting data repository...for the last ten years. These extracts were very old and very large, capturing demographic, financial and clinical information. 
                I first went through the stored procedures used to produce the extracts and identified any areas for optimization while testing to ensure consistency. Next, I updated the packages
                in SSIS to wrap them in a ForLoop container enabling them to run uninterupted. Finally, I created an automated job to allow the package to run early in the morning, until it was terminated to 
                allow for the nightly ETL. Although this process took a long time to complete, it was incredibly satisfactory as it ensured all data generated from the repository was accurate.
